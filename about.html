              ABFloods - A realtime crowd sourced volunteer request queue. It&rsquo;s like twitter crossed with kickstarter!

              <h2>About</h2>
              <p>
				In the coming days and weeks, volunteering for flood relief efforts will need to be more targeted, and more efficient. While social media is great for broadcasting a message, it's inefficient for individual houses, individual supplies, and meeting a specific quantity of support.</p>

                <p>ABFloods is based on Firefeed by Firebase, which was modelled after Twitter. It's built to be fast and scalable. It should run on most devices.</p>

				<p>After a user logs in, they can post a request by filling in their address, needs, and quantity. This request is instantly posted for anyone to accept. Once a post has been accepted, it jumps to the top of the stream so that the remaining spots can be filled by volunteers. When the request has reached it's goal, it is hidden from the stream so that other requests can be met.
			  </p>
			  
			  <h2>Common Courtesy</h2>
              <p>
				<ul>
					<li>Only 'Accept' requests if you are committed to showing up and providing what was requested</li>
					<li>Lots of people have requests for volunteers/supplies. Please keep your requests to a minimum so that others have a chance to be seen too.</li>
			  	</ul>
			  </p>
			
			
			  <h2>Tips</h2>
              <p>
				<ul>
					<li>To finish with the Address Entry box, press Enter/Return.</li>
					<li>Please choose requests that are near you, or travel in groups. Roads are crowded and neighbours need help.</li>
					<li>Make note of an address before you 'Accept' the request. The request will be hidden if the fulfilled number exceeds the requested number!</li>
					<li>If you can provide multiple people/supplies, feel free to fulfill a request multiple times.</li>
					<li>If you have a time restriction/requirement on your request, write it in the post!</li>
					<li>Don't post unless you could use the help immediately. You'll be surprised how quickly volunteers show up!</li>
					<li>If you have, let's say, a request for 3 mops and 5 shovels, and want to make it more straightforward, just make two posts.</li>
					<li>Because this is a rudimentary event manager, you could even post something like "Event: Free BBQ, salad, juice". Note: I've capped the possible quantity of requests at 100</li>
					<li>If the website is acting weird, try refreshing the website.</li>
					<li>You don't need a computer to use this site! Try it on your phone or tablet so you can get to the affected areas even sooner!</li>
				</ul>
